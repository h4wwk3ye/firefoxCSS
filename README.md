# FirefoxCss
Custom userChrome.css for firefox based on [Material Fox](https://github.com/muckSponge/MaterialFox) and [Flying Fox](https://github.com/akshat46/FlyingFox) with few small changes.

## Installation
#### Better use Material Fox and Flying Fox and modify them according to your needs.
- Follow the installation instruction on Flying Fox page. Basically paste the chrome folder and user.js on your profile folder and export config.json on Tree Style Tab options page (or use the custom.css file). 
- Use Firefox Color scheme from Flying Fox page to give sidebar and title bar the same color.

## Please Note
- ###### This is the MACOS branch and I have tested this with macOS Catalina 10.15.7 on Firefox esr v78 and Firefox Developer Edition v86
- ###### The only major changes I have done is the toolbar section on Material Fox which changes the position and icons of the close/min/max and positions them on the same row with url bar.
- ###### And the userContent.css file which changes the default scrollbar.
